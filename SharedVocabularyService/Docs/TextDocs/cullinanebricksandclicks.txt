ABSTRACT Online retailing is growing fast and claims are being made about its positive
environmental impact relative to traditional shopping, particularly by the retailers them-
selves. There is, however, little concrete evidence to support the claims. Whilst there exists
some research into the passenger travel implications of e-shopping, this paper seeks to
analyse the issues involved in online shopping from both a passenger and freight transport
perspective. The objectives of the paper are first, to set out the complex transport relation-
ships involved in online shopping and in particular the interaction between the passenger
and freight aspects and second, to shed some light on the environmental impact of online
shopping. It concludes that as things currently stand, it cannot be stated with any degree
of certainty that clicks are any more environmentally responsible than bricks. The paper is
conceptual in nature and is the pre-cursor to an empirical study of the issue.

Various forecasts have been made over the years of the impact of improving
information and communications technology (ICT) on travel demand. There
has been (and still is), for instance, a great deal of interest in the area of tele-
commuting and its likely impact on travel and the environment. The subject of
telecommuting has raised considerable debate about the need for travel and
human behaviour in relation to it. As the wider, more indirect issues relating to
telecommuting are discovered, the debate still continues as to its net impact on
travel. Home shopping in general, and internet shopping in particular, presents
additional complexities since not only do we need to consider consumers and
their travel behaviour, but we must also consider the freight dimension in terms
of the deliveries of goods ordered to homes. Much of the previous research into
online retailing has focussed either on the consumer side or on the freight side
of the last mile issue (an exception is the paper by Visser and Lanzendorf,
2004). This (conceptual) paper seeks to combine the two. It does not aim to
determine a precise answer as to the impact of online retailing (sometimes

referred to as e-tailing) on the environment, but seeks to set out the complexity
of the issues as a pre-cursor to a future empirical study. The literature review
concentrates principally (but not exclusively) on publications since 2001 since
evidence pre-2001 is thoroughly reviewed in Browne et al. (2001), the OECD/
ECMT (2001) and the Retail Logistics Task Force (Chaired by Prof Alan McKin-
non, 2001) as well as in the ROSETTA (www.trg.soton.ac.uk/rosetta) and
STELLA European projects (www.stellaproject.org).

In common with most research dealing with environmental impacts, one of the
difficulties is deciding where to set the boundaries of the research. This paper
confines itself to the impacts from the shop to the consumer and does not take
into consideration possible impacts arising from changes in either the retail struc-
ture itself or the supply chain configuration. Such changes could include the
closure of shops, relocation of distribution centres, the building of purpose-built
e-fulfilment centres, changes in picking and packing processes, in the sourcing of
products, in inventory levels as well as in the number of stock-keeping units held.
These are substantial and important changes which would require a separate
paper to analyse and are, therefore, beyond the scope of this paper.

Shopping generates a great deal of travel. In GB, the average person aged 16+
makes 219 shopping trips1 a year, accounting for 21% of total trips made per year
(DfT, 2006). Of the 219 trips, 42% are made as car drivers and 21% as car passen-
ger. In terms of mileage, an average person aged 16+ travels 926 miles per year on
shopping trips, 82% of which is done in a car. Over the last ten years, the average
number of shopping trips per person has dropped by 13%, but the average length
of trip has increased by 10% as some people have changed from making frequent
trips to local shops in favour of less frequent trips to edge-of-town or out-of-town
centres. Overall shopping mileage has increased by 22% since the 1993/95
National Travel Survey (DfT, 1996, 2006).

The environmental impact of these trips is considerable. Defra (2007) has calcu-
lated that cars produce 54% of the CO2 emissions of transport, which itself
accounts for 28% of the domestic emissions of CO2 by source.

2 Defra calculates
that each medium-sized petrol car emits 216 grams of CO2 per kilometre (or 348g
per mile). Since vehicle miles travelled (VMT) is the main aggregate variable
determining transport’s carbon footprint, methods to reduce car use are
constantly being sought. One potential candidate for this is online shopping.

Home shopping has been happening for decades and is not confined to online
shopping. In 2007, orders taken in store still account for just over 50% of the home-
shopping market and this mode of shopping is particularly prevalent in the
electrical goods sector (Verdict, 2007). Other home-shopping channels include
television shopping, catalogue or mail-order shopping, telephone ordering and
door-sales shopping. According to Verdict (2007) online retail spending in the UK
in 2006 only accounted for 25% of the home-shopping spend. What is important,
however, is that the £10.9 billion spent online, represented an increase of 33.4% over
the previous year (compared to an average increase in home-shopping of 7.2%).

Online retail spending is one element of a larger e-commerce sector. In 2005,
total internet sales to households amounted to £21.4 billion (ONS, 2005). This
includes all internet sales including financial and other intangible goods. The
£10.9 billion of internet retail sales represents approximately 4% of total retail
sales and is roughly the same proportion as in the USA where e-tail sales
amounted to $104 billion in 2006 (an increase of 18% over the 2005 figures)
(Plunkett Research, 2007). Although this paper concentrates on consumers, it is
interesting to note that B2B (business-to-business) online sales are nearly five
times higher in the UK than B2C (business to consumer) sales; for every £100 of
goods sold online in the UK, £21 represented B2C sales, the remainder being B2B
sales. Proportionately, B2B online sales are also rising at a faster rate than B2C
(ONS, 2005).

E-tailing is obviously dependent on household internet access. Across Europe
(EU 27), household access to broadband internet has increased substantially from
14% in 2004 to 42% in 2007. Household access ranges from 7% in Greece to 74% in
the Netherlands (Eurostat, 2008). In 2007, 61% of households in the UK had inter-
net access and 84% of those had broadband (ONS, 2007). As Cairns et al. (2004)
point out, household access to the internet is not necessarily a limiting factor as
many people have access to it at work.

In 2006, just under half of all men and women used the internet to buy physical
goods, but one in six did not use the internet at all. Of those aged 65+ only one in
four has access to the internet and one in seven has bought online (Mintel, 2007).
However, silver surfer clubs are encouraging older people to use the internet and
in 2005, online spending by the 55+ age group rose by 47% to £458 million (RAC
Foundation, 2006). The RAC Foundation survey of 1000 people found that of
those who use the internet, the main reasons for doing so were: to search for a
better price (75%), to save the hassle of getting out the car or catching a bus (75%),
to save time (73%), to have a better choice (62%) and to save the cost of getting to
the shops (51%).

Home-delivered products can be divided into physical goods (i.e. those that
require to be physically distributed to households) and digitally delivered goods
(which are delivered down the wire) (Fernie and McKinnon, 2004). The most
frequently purchased products are the digitally delivered ones (travel, music,
etc.), whereas the physical goods are less frequently purchased online (ONS,
2007). The difference is a very important one as far as distribution is concerned in
that there are usually no marginal freight trips generated by digitally delivered
goods, whereas the physical goods require at least one freight trip to be delivered
to the customer. In cases where goods are sent by post, there may be no marginal
freight trips generated (except that if the volume of post increases greatly, at some
stage additional post vans may be required). In terms of passenger trips, it makes
less difference whether the goods concerned are digital or physical as it is possi-
ble that the purchase of a theatre ticket online could substitute for a physical
journey to buy it at a box office in the same way as the purchase of a book online
could substitute for a trip to the shops to buy it.

Mintel (2007) divides the e-tailing industry into five major sectors; catalogue
and TV shopping companies (which have obviously changed their mode of retail
to include online ordering) account for 29% of the market, non-food-based retail-
ers 21%, grocery-store-based retailers 21%, offshore companies (i.e. companies
based outside the UK) 16% and pure players (i.e. those who retail only online and
have no physical store presence, such as Amazon) 13%. The largest online retailer
in the UK is Tesco which reported online sales of nearly £1 billion in 2006, with
Argos coming in second, with online sales of £183 million (Mintel, 2007). Online
grocery sales are still rising fast in the UK and are forecast to increase from £2.4
billion in 2007 to £5 billion by 2012 (the Grocer, 13 October 2007). However,
despite all the hype it receives, online grocery sales only account for 2% of the UK
grocery market. It is interesting to note that in 2001, Browne et al. mentioned that
forecasts for online grocery sales were that they would increase from £530 million
in 2000 to £4.96 billion by 2005. Clearly this has not been achieved. In the USA,
online retailing has in fact reported a downturn as people return to the high street
(Daily Mail, 18 June 2007). This does not seem to be a pattern replicated in the UK,
however, as the Interactive Media in Retail Group (IMRG) reported in October
2007 that growth in internet shopping in the nine months to September 2007 was
51.8% higher than for the same period the previous year (IMRG, 2007).

In order to gauge the importance and impact of online shopping, we need to have
some understanding of consumer shopping behaviour in general. There is a large
academic literature on this (see, e.g. Engel et al., 1995; Dubois, 2000; Solomon et al.,
2002) which space does not allow us to pursue. We do need, however, to know
something about consumer spending patterns. Table 2 shows the purchase profile
of shoppers from a large survey by the CfIT of shopping trips (based on 22,885
responses).

Food and non-alcoholic drinks were the most frequently purchased goods, with
publications and stationery (probably frequently amounting to a newspaper),
second. It is interesting that the third most purchased type of good was ‘nothing’
(16% of cases). There are many possible reasons for this latter figure, including the
desired products being out of stock, browsing activity, people shopping for social
reasons and people accompanying others who are making a purchase.

Table 3 shows how much was spent during the average shopping trip. It
illustrates that average spend per trip to the shops is actually very low in many
cases; less than £10 in 43% of cases. This might again support the notion of the
social nature of shopping trips, but could also reflect the influence of any of the
factors mentioned above.

Unfortunately, we know very little about how many products were bought on
the same trip and in what combinations. This information might help us to deter-
mine the similarities and differences between physical and online shopping
behaviours and the impact of online shopping on travel.

The extent of the take-up of online shopping depends greatly on consumer
attitudes towards it. The shopping experience has changed a great deal over the
past century, responding to consumer pressures and the technological capabilities
of the retailers themselves. Parking constraints in town and city centres have

increased the popularity of edge-of-town and out-of-town shopping. However,
retailers have adapted and shopping has become more of a social experience. It
has always been common for department stores to have their own cafes, but now
this extends to book shops, clothes shops and others. In many ways, conventional
shops are becoming more like showrooms where people browse and maybe order
online later once they have inspected the goods physically.

The British Council of Shopping Centres (BCSC) conducts continuous research
into consumer shopping behaviour. In a recent publication (BCSC, 2006, p. 8)
aimed at their members, they state that owners and developers must “understand
that shoppers are faced with a myriad of shopping opportunities, and they have
to give them a reason to keep going to the shops rather than shopping online”.
The main way of achieving this, they state, is to put real emphasis on customer
service in-store. A survey carried out for Accenture (Hoffman and Lowitt, 2007)
of consumers in the USA showed that consumers were actually very dissatisfied
with the service they received in stores. They state (p. 2) that “consumers continue
to experience service annoyances and are responding by not making desired
purchases, creating a revenue leak in retailers’ business models”. The main
sources of these ‘service annoyances’ were ‘too little attention’ and ‘too much
attention’. Poor in-store service is likely to encourage more online shopping.

In the RAC Foundation (2006) survey, when asked to respond to the statement
“In the future people will buy most things online and shops will just become
showrooms for browsing”, 50% disagreed and 39% agreed (with 9% neither
agreeing nor disagreeing). The survey also found that nearly two thirds of 17- to
24-year olds enjoyed shopping as a leisure pursuit. However, there is also anec-
dotal evidence that young people regard shopping online as a leisure pursuit and
do it with friends in a social way.

Cushman and Wakefield (2000) suggest that the retail transition from bricks to
clicks will be as shown in Table 4. Rather than accessing products at the local
store, purchases will be made online from specialist shops all over the world, at
any time of the day from retailers that have a proven record of secure, on-time
delivery. The physical store will become a showcase for products bought subse-
quently online, where people can feel and touch the products and find out any
additional information required.

The main thrust of the difference between the traditional and the new mixed
medium shopping formats, concerns the fragmentation of the shopping process.
Social commentators suggest that we will be buying goods at any time of the day,
including when we are at work. This might also include when we are using public

transport, waiting at airports and even climbing up mountains! The Blackberry
and other such hand-held communication devices enable people to order goods
online from any location where there is a network signal. Retailers are improving
and simplifying their ordering formats in order to facilitate this move, although
sales through this medium are likely to be quite low.

Online shopping and in-store shopping are not direct substitutes. They offer
different experiences and the general consensus of opinion appears to be that
most people will not buy exclusively from either mode but will combine the two
formats. According to Mokhtarian (2004), the difference between in-store shop-
ping and online shopping is as shown in Table 5.

We have already seen (Table 1) how there is a difference in the extent of online
use according to the product being purchased. The same is the case with the type
of person doing the shopping. The BCSC (2006) divides consumers into five
groups with respect to their inclination to shop online. These are: 

In a similar vein, Couclelis (2001) divided the act of shopping into three phases;
before purchase, the purchase itself and after purchase, for each of which there
are two mode possibilities; local (i.e. physical) and remote (i.e. online). Based on
these she divides people into particular kinds of shopper: the traditional shopper
(local/local/local), the cybernaut (remote/remote/remote), the good citizen
(remote/local/remote) and the free rider (local/remote/local). There also
appears to be a gender issue too. Men are more likely to want to shop online than
women (RAC Foundation, 2006).

The direct net impact on the environment, at least on the passenger transport
level, will depend how many people fall into each of the above categories and
how this changes in the future. The RAC Foundation (2006) suggests that for
many goods bought online, almost 80% of purchasers will still travel to the shops

Large choice Sensory information (touch and see)
Lower prices/search costs Tangibility (familiarity with store)
Information easily accessible Immediate possession (take goods away)
Personalisation to customer Social interaction (meeting in store)
Convenience (not having to go out in rain, 
can be done at any time)

to browse and compare. Some shoppers will buy online but collect from store
(i.e. click and collect).What is clear is that the picture is not simple. If people
browse online and shop in-store, some journeys may be saved, but if they browse
in-store and shop online, then it is likely that additional mileage will be incurred
(by the distribution company). However, in the latter case, if people have no
intention of buying in-store when they have made the decision to purchase some-
thing, they may be more inclined to use public transport since they will not
be carrying their purchases home. The CfIT (2006) found that the need to carry
shopping is a significant influence in modal choice between private and public
transport.

Online shopping is not the first telecommunications-enabled influence on travel.
The widespread adoption of the telephone was predicted to have an impact on
travel behaviour (Pool, 1983) as was teleworking. The notion of teleworking, or
telecommuting, has parallels to the online shopping debate, as in its early days, it
was viewed as being totally positive in its impact on travel (i.e. telecommuting
would reduce travel). It has subsequently transpired that this simple relationship
does not necessarily hold.

There is now a substantial literature on telecommuting and its impact on
personal travel (for reviews, see, for instance, Hensher and Golob, 2000; Golob
and Regan, 2001; Mokhtarian and Salomon, 2002; Zhang et al., 2005). Individual
studies have their own specific objectives, but the overall theme of the literature is
to determine to what extent the relationship is substitutional or complementary.
Substitution refers to the extent to which ICT replaces physical travel, whereas
complementarity refers to the extent to which use of ICT is in addition to physical
travel. Hjorthol (2002, p. 438) refines this binary division slightly by suggesting
that there are four ways in which new technology can interact with old: 

In assessing the carbon footprint of e-tailing, it is the net effect of substitution/
complementarity (i.e. after taking into account all the modification, generation,
additional and substitutional effects) that we are interested in determining as it is
this that determines the overall environmental impact.

Most studies of the direct impact of telecommuting on travel suggest that there is
a net benefit but that the benefits are tempered by elements of complementarity.
For instance, telecommuters may use their cars for shorter trips associated with

activities other than work on the days they are telecommuting, or the car that was
previously used for commuting by one family member may be used by another
family member for a different purpose. Complementarity effects are not always
predictable. For instance, a study by Balepur et al. (1998) on the telecentres project
in California found that although person and VMT decreased as a result of the
telecentres, because people were not driving so far to work, they were coming
home for lunch and carrying out other activities by car.

A thorough review of the telecommuting literature undertaken by Cairns et al.
(2004) for the UK Department for Transport came to the conclusion that although
much of the US literature on teleworking and telecommuting suggested that the
complementarity effects either balanced or outweighed the substitutional effects,
most of this literature was ‘based on speculation rather than empirical evidence’.
They go on to review a host of empirical studies, nearly all of which illustrate that
although complementary car use reduced the overall impact of teleworking, total
VMT reduced as a result of teleworking. Indeed, they found some evidence (from
a study by Pendyala et al., 1991) that teleworkers chose to travel to non-work
activities that were closer to home, exhibiting ‘contracted action spaces’. A very
similar conclusion was reached following a review of the literature for the DLTR
(2002).

Not all research has reinforced the link between telecommuting and reductions
in travel. Hjorthol’s (2002) study of telecommuting in Norway concluded that
“stationary communication seems to be a supplement to activities based on
mobile technology but it gives people more spatial and temporal options”
(p. 451). The stationary communication referred to here by Hjorthol is the
computer and the mobile technology is the car. This study found that VMT
actually increased as a result of telecommuting.

As stated above, much of the telecommuting literature is confined to
determining the extent of substitution versus complementarity. In terms of the
environmental impact, however, although number of VMT is probably the key
overall variable, there are also important issues about the type of miles being
driven. This has been the subject of a great deal of Mokhtarian’s work in rela-
tion to telecommuting. In a paper by Koenig et al. (1996), the authors set out to
model the environmental impact of telecommuting, but not simply by using
the traditional variables such as VMT or number of trips because as they state: 

These traditional measures only partially explain vehicle emissions. The
vehicle emission process is very complex involving the interaction of
numerous other factors including: the vehicle types and pollution control
technologies in the fleet; how the vehicles are operated (speeds, accelera-
tion/deceleration etc.) other travel related indicators (such as number of
cold and hot engine starts); and environmental conditions (including
season and ambient temperature). (p. 14)

One of the benefits of telecommuting is that the number of cold starts is reduced
since, although the car is still used during the day for other reasons, it is not
necessarily being used first thing in the morning when starting the car creates the
most emissions. Koenig et al. (1996) also found that telecommuting meant less
freeway driving but more driving on small, residential roads, which is dispropor-
tionately more environmentally damaging.

Having briefly reviewed the debate on telecommuting and travel, we now return
to online shopping and the question of whether it will ultimately be beneficial or
detrimental to the environment. Many of the issues raised above concerning
telecommuting are equally valid in relation to online shopping. It is important to
determine to what extent the online shopping is substitutional and to what extent
it is complementary and also to consider the direct and indirect effects. James and
Hopkinson (2001) aptly describe the dichotomy as being between ‘quieter roads
and fuller baskets’ as people stay at home and interact more with the local
community, or ‘e-road rage’ where home shopping increases delivery van
movements and people use their cars for other purposes instead.

In an early paper on the effect of electronic home shopping on travel, Gould
and Golob (1997) investigated the complex relationship between e-shopping and
personal travel. They carried out a multi-diary activity and travel survey in the
Portland Metropolitan area of the USA. They concluded that the elimination of
some shopping trips would probably lead to an increase in trips for other reasons,
particularly in the case of women, where there was a latent demand for ‘mainte-
nance trips’, e.g. eating meals, medical care, picking up or dropping off of passen-
gers, taking care of household or personal obligations. They also investigated the
relationship between teleworkers and their shopping habits. They considered the
idea, for instance, that teleworkers may be less likely to shop online, since they
may shop more locally. Additionally, they postulated that since many shopping
trips are part of a trip-chain linked to the daily commute, teleworkers shopping-
related VMT could be higher than conventional workers.

Cairns (2005) suggests that another complementarity effect of online shopping
is that consumers who would previously have walked or cycled to the shops may
choose to have home deliveries, thereby increasing the total VMT. Research in the
Netherlands (Transport en Logistiek Nederland, 2000, quoted in Retail Logistics
Task Force, 2001) supports this notion. They calculated that if 11.5% of total sales
are purchased online and delivered to the home by 2005, there would be a 17%
increase in VMT because of the substitution of walking and cycling trips by
motorized deliveries. Cairns also suggests, however, that if online shopping
became the norm, it might actually encourage some people to give up their cars
altogether. A contrary view put forward by Visser and Lanzendorf (2004) is that
the growth in online shopping may cause shops in more remote areas to close
down, forcing people without cars in these areas to buy one, thereby increasing
vehicle mileage.

One of the complexities suggested by Gould and Golob (1997) is that online
shopping allows the shopper to expand their horizons in terms of their shopping
location. For instance, if a person is looking for a specific item, rather than confin-
ing their search to the local town, they may search online and find it cheaper
further afield and travel to purchase it. This notion is supported by Ferrell (2004)

who analysed data from an activity diary survey of residents in the San Francisco
Bay area and found that “teleshopping households engage in more shopping
trips, travel longer distances for shopping and chain more of their shopping trips”
(p. 241) and that the benefits of the trip chaining “are being overwhelmed by the
complementary effects of home shopping on shop travel” (p. 241). In contrast,
Cairns et al. (2004, p. 316) after reviewing the small number of empirical studies
on the complementarity effects of teleshopping, come to the conclusion that
whilst it may generate some offsetting travel, teleshopping “is likely to reduce
personal car use”.

Mokhtarian (2004) sets out a conceptual analysis of the impact of online shop-
ping on travel based on a more aggregate economic consideration of some of the
indirect effects. On the personal travel side, she states that many shopping trips
are made as part of a trip chain and the amount of travel reduced by ordering
online is actually quite low. Browne et al. (2001, p. 44) suggest that grocery shop-
ping “is typically carried out as a dedicated car trip, so home shopping and deliv-
ery in the grocery sector does often lead to the removal of an entire shopping
trip”. There appears to be little hard evidence for this assertion, however, and
further research is required to validate it. There is still also the question of the
second round effects concerning alternative uses of the car if it is not being used
for shopping.

On the freight side, amongst other things, Mokhtarian addresses the possibility
that because goods are cheaper online, more will be demanded and this in turn
will increase the number of deliveries made. Additionally, online ordering
increases the potential for goods to travel further as they can be ordered from
anywhere in the world. She also looks at the changing demographics to assess
likely influences on aggregate demand and therefore freight movements. Overall
she comes to the conclusion that: 

The combined outcome of all factors does not appear to support any hope
that e-shopping will reduce travel on net; to the contrary there may be
negative impacts due to increased travel, even if those impacts are likely
to be localised and/or small in magnitude for the most part (Mokhtarian,
2004, p. 257).

Similar arguments are raised by Hesse (2002, p. 229) who argues that e-tailing is
just another step in the development of logistics structures which will not
impinge on cultural mores. He suggests that shopping is a cultural experience
and that “new technologies are deeply embedded in culture and in social prac-
tices, in daily routines and habits that are far from being rapidly changed by new
order-and-delivery services”. On the freight side, he argues that e-tailing will
result in a greater propensity to use air transport (environmentally more damag-
ing) because of both the time sensitive nature of e-tailing and the ability to order
and source goods from further afield. He also argues that huge e-fulfilment and
consolidation centres will need to be built (and that they will not replace the tradi-
tional warehouse, but will be in addition to them), often on greenfield sites, to
cope with the distribution of products bought online.

A further, longer term impact of e-shopping is that on residential location.
There is some evidence that telecommuting increases the distance from work that
people are prepared to live (Pendyala et al., 1991; Hjorthol, 2002; White et al.,
2007). If, on top of telecommuting, you can also shop online and have goods

delivered to your door, this might reinforce the decision to live in a more remote
location. Shen (2000) modelled the impact of new telecommunications in general
on residential location and found that “as the level of substitution of telecommu-
nications for transportation increases substantially, the residential location
flexibility of those households that have technological capabilities is significantly
enhanced” (p. 1458). This would mean that the number of trips made might
reduce, but their length would increase, perhaps substantially. Ironically, Shen
suggested that it was the non-IT-enabled trips that reduced the possibility for
locational flexibility (e.g. members of the household that relied on public trans-
port to carry out activities). With shopping becoming an IT-enabled activity,
according to Shen’s logic, a substantial increase in locational flexibility might
result.

Turning to the type of trip that is replaced by online shopping, in the UK, the
majority (63%) of shopping trips by car take place between 1000 hours and 1600
hours, outside of the peak congestion time (ONS, 2007). The issue of cold starts,
therefore, is less relevant. Furthermore, the marginal environmental benefit in
reducing a shopping trip should be less than that of reducing a commuting trip
because the shopping trip is less likely to take place in congested conditions. On
the other hand, shopping trips are more likely to take place on smaller roads
rather than on main roads, and this results in a marginal increase in environmen-
tal cost over the same length commuting trip.

So to what extent is online shopping a substitute for physical travel? The RAC
Foundation (2006) found that 80% of online purchases still resulted in a physical
journey. As Mokhtarian (2004, p. 6) puts it: in e-shopping “products are detached
from the physical cues afforded by a bricks-and-mortar store”. Consumers there-
fore are likely to browse before purchasing online. Returning to the discussion on
shoppers behaviour, people are social beings. In the case of telecommuting,
although telecommuters reduce their VMT on the commuting trip, they tend to use
their car for other things during the telecommuting day. Mokhtarian (2004, p. 9)
suggests that “It is likely that a number of shopping trips are ‘invented’ in order to
justify (often subconsciously) an urge simply to get out and go somewhere”.

The freight dimension of online shopping is also a complex issue. Cairns (2005)
models the impact of home deliveries of groceries specifically on traffic and
suggests that online grocery deliveries could reduce vehicle km by at least 70%.
Although she briefly considers some of the indirect affects in her discussion of the
validity of her and others’ models, she still concludes that there will be a substan-
tial reduction in traffic. She suggests that the grocery market is somewhat unique,
however, in that it is “typically a trip least valued in its own right” (p. 53) and is
highly car dependent because of the need to carry things. The implication is that
there is less likelihood of complementarity in this sector than others.

Many retailers are making claims about the greenness of this method of distri-
bution. Jonathan Faiman, co-founder of Ocado, the online supermarket which
works in partnership with Waitrose, claimed for instance that “each Ocado van
replaces up to 20 cars on the road which overall can result in huge savings of
unnecessary car journeys” (Guardian, 2007, p. 9). The environmental section of
the Tesco website (Tesco, 2008, www.tesco.com/greenerliving) boasts that each
delivery van saves 6000 car journeys per year. The validity of these claims (and

Online shopping is usually delivered to consumers in diesel vans.3 Vehicle for
vehicle, a van is more environmentally polluting than a car. Vans delivering
goods ordered online are in most cases a total addition to the vehicle stock in the
UK. In some cases they are replacing HGVs, but in the majority of cases they are
performing a function that was previously not performed by a goods vehicle.
Although not entirely a result of online shopping, the number of vans in the UK
has increased substantially over the past ten years and there are now five times as
many vans in GB as HGVs. They consume 25% of the total diesel and 3% of the
total petrol used by all motorized vehicles in GB (Browne et al., 2007). According
to Defra (2007), vans account for 13% of the CO2 emissions of transport in the
UK. Of course, not all of the vans on the road are used for home deliveries; the
DfT (2004) calculates that freight transport only accounts for approximately 1/3
of van kilometres. McKinnon (2007) has pointed out, however, that a problem
with GB van statistics is determining the number that are used for freight
deliveries at all.

Delivery vans, by their very nature, are also continuously stop-starting. This
type of vehicle operation is bad for the environment (although this type of
operation with a high drop-density is better environmentally than the situation
where each retail company makes its own deliveries, often with lower drop-
densities). Additionally, they often have to park at the side of the road causing
traffic obstruction and slowing the free-flow of traffic (adding further to the
environmental problems).

The notion of fragmentation of the shopping activity and product flow which
results from online shopping has been discussed above. This in itself causes its
own problems. Cairns (2005) argues that for grocery shopping, in many cases, the
online shop is likely to be a direct replacement for a physical shop. Even if this
were to be the case, for the non-grocery shop the situation could be very different.
Rather than one trip to the shops to buy a selection of things (e.g. clothes from
several different shops, plus a few household goods), if bought online, each of
these things would be ordered at a different time of the day, but more impor-
tantly, from a different company, sometimes requiring separate delivery (depend-
ing on the extent of load consolidation). If this is the case, the number of freight
trips generated could be huge and although delivery companies obviously
combine deliveries for many different people in one van, there is likely to be an
overall increase in VMT by van.

One of the problems with online shopping is that, for non-letterbox size products,
the customer often needs to be at home to receive the goods bought. For whatever
reason, this is not always possible. The IMRG reckons that 11% of deliveries fail
on first attempt and 2% fail altogether. McKinnon and Tallam (2003) found that in

cases where parcel carriers refuse to leave consignments unsecured, the level of
failed deliveries exceeds 20%. The DTi (2001) suggests that in cases where no
delivery time has been specified in advance, the failure to deliver rate is around
60%. The higher the number of failed deliveries, the greater the VMT by vans and
the greater the pollution caused. McLeod et al. (2006) point out that failed deliver-
ies also lead to increased car journeys as customers eventually need to pick up
their deliveries from the carrier’s depot (quite often located in an edge-of-town
location, inaccessible by public transport).

There is also some evidence that when purchasing online, people actually over-
order knowing that they will send some of it back. For instance, because it is
impossible to try on clothes bought online, consumers may buy several sizes and
even several colours and send back what they do not like. Fernie and McKinnon
(2004) state that around 25% of goods purchased online are returned. Nairn (2003)
suggests that this increases to 30% of non-food products, compared to 6–10% in
the case of physical shops. Returns also add to the number of van trips made,
although the overall impact on VMT depends on the returns policy of the
company (some companies require customers to return goods through the postal
service or through local agents) and the extent to which returns can be integrated
with existing trips.

The customer requires as narrow a delivery slot as possible, preferably an hour,
so that they are not waiting around for a delivery. For the distribution company,
however, the wider the delivery window, the lower the cost of delivery. Nockold
(2001) modelled the impact on transport costs of varying the window delivery
width in the London area. He found that a reduction in the window width from
3 hours to 1.5 hours resulted in a cost increase of 17–24% and elimination of
windows altogether resulted in savings of between 27% and 37%. In terms of the
environment, wider windows also equate to reduced costs per delivery. Ocado
customers can choose a green van delivery display when they are buying online
which means that they can take advantage of a van already allocated to their area.

It must be recognized that online shopping is in its infancy and to date, the logis-
tical systems developed to deal with it have often adapted on a piecemeal basis.
Some have reached a high level of sophistication using routeing and scheduling
software and picking and packing processes to minimize distance travelled and
maximize drop-density. Dedicated home-delivery companies, consolidating
products from a number of online retailers, have also emerged. However, anoma-
lies still exist. Customers ordering multiple products from a single online retailer
may not necessarily receive all their items in one delivery because of the picking
system used. This can result in trip duplication (as well as customer dissatisfac-
tion). In the future, aspects of online shopping could change significantly. Most of
the major grocery retailers are experimenting with less environmentally damag-
ing vans, such as electrically powered vans, vans powered by biofuels and others.

By 2010, it looks from the websites of the large grocery companies, like at least
nearly all urban grocery deliveries will made in such vehicles. This obviates some
of the problems alluded to above, but does not address all the issues (and there is
still the issue of the upstream environmental effects of the power generation to be
dealt with).

Research has been ongoing into the ‘not at home’ or unattended delivery issue,
with solutions such as secure lockers, local drop-off and collection points and
community delivery points all being considered (see Punakivi et al., 2001;
McKinnon and Tallam, 2003; Fernie and McKinnon, 2004). The research centres
around finding a solution which balances security (of products delivered and of
the premises to which they are delivered), cost (of providing the solution) and
practicality for both the customer and the carrier. Home-based reception boxes
have been tried in several places but most experiments have been curtailed due to
a combination of costs being too high and usage being too low (McKinnon and
Tallam, 2003). In Helsinki, Punakivi and Tanskanen (2002) carried out research on
shared reception boxes (which can be placed at petrol stations, tobacconists or
elsewhere) and found that transport costs were 55–66% lower than with unat-
tended delivery and two-hour delivery windows. However, the idea was not
operationalized.

Unattended delivery possibilities would eliminate the return journeys problem
outlined in points 4.3 and, to a certain extent, the problem alluded to in 4.5 above.
They might also allow the delivery of goods overnight when congestion is lower
(although the noise creation could be a problem). However, an important point
here is the extent to which eliminating these problems might actually stimulate
demand for online shopping. At present, it seems likely that many people would
prefer to shop physically for some items because they cannot, or do not want to, be
at home waiting for deliveries. In certain circumstances an increase in the propor-
tion of online shopping could improve the situation for consumers as frequency of
deliveries to any one area could improve as demand from that area increases.

The environmental consequences of a large increase in online shopping are
even more highly debatable since this probably would require changes to the
entire structure of the distribution system. On the positive side, an increase in
the proportion of online shopping should improve both the drop densities and
the vehicle loading percentages. For instance, if either more people in a specific
area order goods online from a specific retailer, or each person ordering orders
more, the distance travelled by each delivery vehicle should decrease and the
vehicle utilization should increase. This would be environmentally beneficial.

There is also discussion about company collaboration on consignment consoli-
dation, whereby consignments going to a specific geographical location from
different companies might be consolidated at a convenient location for final
delivery to the consumer. To some extent, use of parcel delivery services such as
DHL and UPS are already performing this function, but many companies do not
use such services. Collaboration requires a great deal of trust on behalf of the
companies involved, particularly since the distribution company is the interface
between the retailer and the customer. Customer service perception is very
dependent on this final leg of the journey. Indeed, Esper et al. (2003) found that in
the USA, perception of the carrier had a significant influence on the consumer
decision as to whether or not to buy online. The Royal Mail (2007) home shopping
tracker study survey also showed that 70% of respondents liked to know which
company would be delivering their goods.

Consolidation has been a central feature of city logistics for many years and a
whole academic literature has built up around it (see, for instance, Taniguchi
et al., 2001; Browne et al., 2005; Visser and Hassal, 2005). It needs to be even more
widely used, encompassing much more than logistics in urban areas, if online
shopping is to be the environmentally responsible shopping option.

It is clear that, despite the claims of the major UK grocers, the impact of online
shopping on the environment is not clear cut. Rather the issue is complex and
dynamic, involving human behaviour as well as hard business decisions. If the
only considerations taken into account are the direct and static ones, i.e. one van
replaces 20 shopping journeys, then on balance, yes, it appears that online shop-
ping could be environmentally responsible. However, when consumer behaviour
and the subtle interactions between shopping and other activities as well as the
dynamics of household travel patterns are taken into consideration, the whole
issue becomes much more complex. Combining the passenger travel complexities
together with those on the freight side and also adding into the pot the problem of
where to set the boundaries in terms of looking at the travel and environmental
impacts makes the whole agenda fraught with difficulties. What is clear,
however, is that there is an over-riding need for further study, particularly in
light of the projections for the future of online shopping.

1. A shopping trip is defined in the National Travel Survey as a trip to the shops or from the shops to
home even if there is no intention to buy. A trip to the shops where there is no direct shop-home or
home-shop element is not included in the statistics.

2. Source figures allocate emissions according to where the fuel is consumed and so do not attribute
emissions arising from fuel refining or electricity generation to the transport sector but to the
energy sector. Figures include all transport except international air and sea.
